## Project Information

The aim of this project is to revive old images and videos by colorizing them using DeOldify and Python Deep Learning. Old images and videos can lose their color over time and can also become faded, making it hard to see the details. By using DeOldify and Python Deep Learning, we can restore the color and enhance the quality of these old images and videos.
